# Team Bronze Miner
 Information Mining & Analysis Group project
##The code of the project is divided into five parts.

1. EDA files include descriptive analysis of the data, correlation analysis and information visualizations.
2. Numerial Mining includes models for numerical variables such as linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
3. Text Mining includes data mining models for text variables such as CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, RoBERTa, and GPT2.
4. Time Series Analysis includes the construction of ARIMA models.
5. LDA includes the process of topic modeling.
